## Proposal üí≠

Develop a web platform with the given interface that allows the users to register their full name, country, and birthday.\
Create a container with components that bring up a form with:

- Name
- Surname
- Country (dropdown of countries)
- Year of birth
- Save button

Once the form is saved, it should show a message that refers to the next birthday as such:

> __Hello__ {name} __from__ {country}. __on__ {day} __of__ {month} __you will be__ {years} __old__!

Also has to show a list with all the entries made.

## Architecture üè∞

I decided to use a Layered Architecture approach, both on the backend and frontend.

The backend layers are:

1. Domain - detain the core business rules, Entities and Commands (Interactors, Use Cases)
2. Infrastructure - Controllers (Input) and Repositories (Services)

The frontend layers are:

1. Domain - detain the core business rules, Entities and Use Cases contracts
2. Data - Use Cases implementation and Infrastructure contracts
3. State - management of the app state and communication with Use Cases
4. Presentation - Input and visual components
5. Infrastructure - interface with external world

The dependencies are mounted by the main layer through dependency injection

## How to run üÜô

### Backend

Create a `.env` file in the backend root folder with the following values:
```sh
PORT=8080
MONGO_USERNAME=sammy
MONGO_PASSWORD=your_password
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_DB=mosano_challenge
MONGO_HOSTNAME=db
```

Install dependencies, build containers and start backend:
```sh
cd backend      // open backend directory
yarn            // install dependencies
make install    // build containers
make up         // start project
```

### Frontend

Install dependencies and run project
```sh
cd frontend      // open frontend directory
yarn             // install dependencies
yarn start       // start project
```

## Good to notice that... üëÄ

|App is 100% responsive           |Even the table component!|All form fields have validation|
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|

Also, if you're not logged in, all the users registered are not save to the db. You also can't edit or delete users!
If you want to login, I've seed 3 default accounts on the db! Here are them:

```ts
{
	email: 'nelson@mosano.eu',
	password: 'benfica',
},
{
	email: 'carlos@mosano.eu',
	password: 'botafogo',
},
{
	email: 'francisco@mosano.eu',
	password: 'portofc',
},
```

## Todo ‚ùï‚ùï

Well, after 7 days, a weekend lost (or invested?), and hours and hours of work, I decided it was the time to finish this project. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to setup the test environments for it. As configuring Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (w/ Typescript, Eslint, etc) is a non trivial task (witch we don't do every day btw) and would take some time and research, I decided to leave it as it is for now. But definitely it's a big of a "TODO", that couldn't be neglected in a real project. So, here it is:

- [ ] Add tests setup for /frontend
- [ ] Add tests setup for /backend
- [ ] Test stuff bro
- [ ] Be less lazy next time

## The end üîö

So that's it folks! Thanks for the challenge, that was awesome!
